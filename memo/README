Memo Pad Application

This app is intended to replicate much of the functionality of the old
Treo Memopad application.  It allows the user to assign categories and
view lists of memos by category.

Data is stored in a MySQL database.  At the current time, maintenance
of the categories and deletion of memos is accomplished theough
phpMyAdmin.
